## Set up your Local Development Environment

### This website is built using [Docusaurus2.0](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

Follow the following instructions to start contributing.

**1.** Fork [this](https://github.com/kubesimplify/website) repository.

**2.** Clone your forked copy of the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/kubesimplify.git
```

**3.** Navigate to the project directory.

```
cd kubesimplify
```

**4.** Add a reference (remote) to the original repository.

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/kubesimplify/website.git
```

**5.** Check the remotes for this repository.

```
git remote -v
```

**6.** Create a new branch.

```
git checkout -b <your_branch_name>
```

**7.** Install the dependencies for running the site.

```
yarn
```

**8.** Run the site locally to preview changes.

```
yarn start
```

This will run a local webserver with "live reload" conveniently enabled at `localhost/3000`.

**9.** Make desired changes to files.

**10.** Track your changes.

```
git add  <file_name>
```

**11.** Commit your changes. To contribute to this project, you must agree to the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://github.com/dcoapp/app#how-it-works) for each commit you make.

```
git commit --signoff -m "<your commit message>"
```

or

```
git commit -s -m "<your commit message>"
```

**12.** Push the committed changes in your local branch to your remote repo.

```
git push -u origin <your_branch_name>
```

**13.** Once youâ€™ve committed and pushed all of your changes to GitHub, go to the page for your fork on GitHub, select your development branch, and click the _pull request button_. Please ensure that you compare your feature branch to the desired branch of the repo you are supposed to make a PR to.

**_:trophy: After this, the maintainers will review the PR and will merge it if it helps move the Kubesimplify website project forward. Otherwise, it will be given constructive feedback and suggestions for the changes needed to add the PR to the codebase._**

**14.** While you are working on your branch, other developers may update the `master` branch with their branch. Such scenarios make your branch out of date with the `master` branch with missing content. So to fetch the new changes, follow along:

```
git checkout master
git fetch origin master
git merge upstream/master
git push origin
```

Now you need to merge the `master` branch into your branch. This can be done in the following way:

```
git checkout <your_branch_name>
git merge master
```

## All the best! ðŸ¥‡
